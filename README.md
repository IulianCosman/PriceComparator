üß† Assumptions & Design Decisions

- CSV filenames follow the pattern: store_yyyy-MM-dd.csv or store_discounts_yyyy-MM-dd.csv.

- The same product_name string is assumed to identify the same product across stores.

- Units like g and ml are normalized to kg and l for value comparison.

- Products and discounts are saved with dateAdded derived from the filename.

- Alerts are persisted and checked on a schedule (can be run manually too).

- Assumed only one discount can be active at a store per product.

- Price per unit logic helps recommend better deals even across different package sizes.
